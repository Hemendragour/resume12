 * Builds a single prompt that does TWO jobs in one LLM call:
 *
 *  1. Evaluate the most recent answer (if any) and return structured feedback.
 *  2. Decide the NEXT question — either a follow-up that digs deeper into the
 *     answer just given, or a fresh question on a new topic — while staying
 *     within the fixed totalQuestions budget the user picked.
 *
 * Combining both into one call halves the number of round trips compared to
 * "evaluate" + "generate" as two separate requests.
